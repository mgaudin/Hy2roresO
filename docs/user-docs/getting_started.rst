A quick introduction
--------------------

This is a quick introduction about our plugin. Please refer to another page for more details.

Installing the plugin
---------------------

From the repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you would like to get the latest code of the plugin, you can install it directly from the repository. The repository is in Github here. There are 2 ways that you can do generally:

* Download the zip from github here: `ZIP Master`_, extract the zip, and copy the extracted root directory into QGIS local plugins directory (on Linux it’s ``~/.local/share/QGIS/QGIS3/profiles/default/python/plugins`` where ``~`` is ``/home/USER``, on Windows it’s ``C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Roaming\QGIS\QGIS3\profiles\default\python\plugins``)

.. _ZIP Master : https://github.com/mgaudin/Hy2roresO/archive/master.zip

* Use git: clone the repository in that directory or clone in your preferred location and use symbolic link in local plugins directory.

From QGIS Plugin Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unfortunately, you won't be able to download the plugin from the QGIS Plugin Manager.

The :doc:`..\about-docs\contribute` page has more information on getting in touch.
