Hy2roresO treats a whole bunch of cases that can happen with natural hydrological networks. However, there is still some things that can be realized to improve the plugin. 
One thing that can be done is to create fictive network inside the islands, for example by using a skeleton of the geometry of the island. This could for example improve the definition of strokes that are arriving in an island if this one is twisted for example
