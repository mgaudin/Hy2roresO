We would like to thank very much our mentor, Cécile Duchêne, for her time, her patience and her dedication to the accomplishment of this project.

We also thank Guillaume Touya, head of the COGIT Research Unit at the Institut National de l'Information Géographique et Forestière (IGN), for his precious advices on the implementation of the computation of stream orders algorithms.

Greetings to the Ecole Nationale des Sciences Géographiques for the working conditions provided.

Finally, a thought to Nicolas, Luc, Marion, Alice, Jocelyn, Matthieu, Hugo and most of the time Robin, that supported us during the whole development of this project.
